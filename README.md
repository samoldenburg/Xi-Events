# Xi-Events

Currently in development and non-functional, Xi Events intends to be a simple to use and flexible events system for Wordpress, without any extra frills or features that are not necessary for general events/calendar usage.

While the majority of classes in this plugin are object oriented, they are mostly static and used for namespace and organizational purposes.
